1. What is it?
	A framework for presenting comic strips on the web
	Fully customizable environment in which to present a comic
		- The presentation environment is often overlooked by artists - this is old thinking!

2. Why create it?
	Most importantly, because this interests me:
		- Lifelong fan of comics as a storytelling medium
	Most comic strip presentation systems are outdated:
		- Either just WordPress fitted for comics, or look like they're websites from back in the 2000s
			...Or some combination of the worst parts of both those things

3. Goals:
	Static hosting compatible:
		- Free static hosting makes it accessible on more hosts with more choice
		- Nothing about the functionality of most comic strips necessarily needs to be server-processed
	Keep it lightweight in terms of processing power
	Minimize bandwidth consumption:
		- Most comics webpages are fairly wasteful, so do better

4. Features:
	Smart caching for a smoother user experience
	Automatic visual scaling to fit more screens comfortably
	Animation effects to give the presentation of comic a sense of life, instead of feeling static
	Ability to custom-script actions and changes to the page when a comic enters or leaves view
	
5. How did I do it?
	Leverage newer, more advanced asynchronous request APIs:
		- No reason to reload the whole page for every strip
		- All data loaded from simple, static text files containing JSON
	Coded from scratch; no outside libraries to add unneeded bloat
	Visual effects use modern animation APIs in JavaScript (requestAnimationFrame)

6. Thanks!
